# Summary

The Pashto-Sikaram treebank is a native UD treebank with manually annotated texts from various sources.

# Introduction

The treebank contains manual annotations of 40 created natively in UD. This includes:
* 20 [Cairo CICLing](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/cairo) sentences with interesting syntactic constructions translated from English
* 20 original Pashto sentences from the book "Pashto and the Need for Translation" (Salih Mohammad Salih)
In the future, the treebank will be populated with more sentences from the book and hopefully also news articles.

Apart from the manual native annotation of lemmas, universal Part-of-Speech tags and dependency relations,
the Pashto-Sikaram treebank contains transliteration of forms and lemmas into Latin alphabet and English translation and glosses.


# Acknowledgments
